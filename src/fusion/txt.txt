## First we need a motion estimation model for a mobile robot or autonomous vehicle
# for 50hz vehicle not faster! and small change in the heading angle (constant heading rate)
theta_1 = thetat_0 + delta_theta_1
x_1 = x_0 + delta_s_1 * cost(theta_0 + delta_theta_1/2)
y_1 = y_0 + delta_s_1 * sin(theta_0 + delta_theta_1 /2)
delta_s = v_x * delta_t
delta_theta = theta_dot * delta_t


this was from a youtube video
I remeber i used this for a mobile robot once in matlab

x1 = x0 + v*cos(theta)*delta_t
y1 = y0 + v*sin(theta)*delta_t
theta = theta_0 + omega*delta_t


more sophistaced kinemtatics can be utilized if you want more accuracy
